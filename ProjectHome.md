This project is a Java library to facilitate communication over NFCIP (Peer 2
Peer) using ACS ACR122 NFC terminals and/or Nokia NFC capable phones. The
library provides a reliable (i.e. resumes after connection tear) byte array
communication channel between these NFC devices. This project provides a
library for running in the Java SE and Java ME environment.

The library was tested with:
  * two ACS ACR122 readers (firmware ACR122U102)
  * a Nokia 6131 NFC phone

This library was tested on:
  * Windows Vista SP1, Sun's JDK 6 Update 13
  * Fedora 11 x86\_64 with the provided OpenJDK
  * Ubuntu 9.04 x86\_64 with the provided OpenJDK
